Over the summer of 2021, I interned on the NVIDIA Rapids Data Viz team. My favorite thing I made over there was a simple website that let you interact with a dataset stored on the GPU. While things like [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/) have let you leverage the GPU from the browser for a while now, we enabled the use of CUDA data structures straight from the browser. This eliminated the constraint of needing to store datasets in the browser, which allows for working with billions of points at once. The gif above shows this on a graph with so many edges you can't even see the background.
