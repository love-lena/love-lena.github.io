          Hi, I'm Lena! I'm a Software Developer and Computer Engineer in California.
          I'm currently finishing my undergrad at UCSC and looking for work.

            <h3><a href="">Vending Machine Network</a></h3>

            My engineering capstone project at UCSC is building a connected vending machine. The "vending machine" part isn't that important to what I want to talk about here. I want to focus on my approach to designing and implementing a scalable IoT service.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/public/svmstack.png" alt="tech stack">

The basis of this whole thing will be [fastify](https://www.fastify.io/), a really fast web framework that I have been enjoying. One of its main selling points is how bare bones it is. You can pull in functionality via plugins exactly when you need it. 

The IoT component will be [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/), a standard in IoT for good reason. The publisher/subscriber model is great for managing many devices that may disconnect or drop messages. 
I used [oracle mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/), since it's pretty easy to setup and I wanted to use a self hosted broker.

The front end is a static web app powered by [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

I have this all running in AWS, which is my go to when standing up a web service. The only AWS exclusive tool I am using is [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), but you could switch it out with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) without too much work. 

The only big structural change needed now would be putting everything behind a proxy. Once that is in place, this whole thing is highly scalable and pretty damn fast.

            <p>A small plugin for fastify that allows you to share the same MQTT connection in all parts of your server.</p>

<p>Published on npm, you can use it in your fastify project with</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm i fastify-mqtt</code></p>

            <h3><a href="">TensorFlow Lite experiments</a></h3>

            <p>I had a lab assignment in an embedded systems class that I thought was a good opportunity to check out <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite">TF Lite</a>.</p>

<p>Given some sample of voltage, determine the frequency of a sine wave signal.</p>

<p>I started by exploring the data measured by my microcontroller and generating some sine waves with gaussian noise. This let me create thousands of training samples very quick.</p>

<p><img src="/public/exploration.png" alt="exploration" /></p>

<p>I tried out a few different models, and I found that adding more dense layers helped with prediction accuracy, but was very expensive in terms of model size. Ultimately, I went with two dense layers with 32 neurons each.</p>

<p>Looking at some tests runs, we can see that the model performs reasonably well.</p>

<p><img src="/public/run.png" alt="predictions" /></p>

<p>To prepare the model for an embedded deployment, I convert it to a Lite model (250kb → 40kb) and quantize it (40kb → 10kb). Even at 4% the size, the new model performs well.</p>

<p>Over the summer of 2021, I interned on the NVIDIA Rapids Data Viz team. My favorite thing I made over there was a simple website that lets you interact with a dataset stored on the GPU. While things like <a href="https://deck.gl/">deck.gl</a> have let you leverage the GPU from the browser for a while now, we enabled the use of CUDA data structures straight from the browser. This means we can work with billions of points at once. The video above shows this on a graph with so many edges you can’t even see the background.</p>
